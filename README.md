## SRL-neon

Scripts made with SRL and WaspLib to be used alongside RuneLite and its plugins.

### Requirements:

- 32-bit installation of RuneLite
- Custom window chroma disabled from RuneLite's settings
- ALMOST ALL plugins have to be turned off in RuneLite

### Thanks to:

- Torwent (waspscripts.com, SRL-T and WaspLib)
- Slacky (answering my questions, work towards SRL)
- Flight (tutorials on villavu and helping with questions)
